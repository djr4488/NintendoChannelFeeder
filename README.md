Nintendo Channel Feeder
=======================

Preserve the functionality of some of the Wii channels; Forecast, News, and Everybody Votes

Initial goal
============

Just send the files that have been already captured and check out the Wii calls out to get those files.  This is done.

Mid goal
========

This actually becomes a bit harder, but change data in the files and see how the Wii reacts.  What does it validate.

Long term goal
==============

Create the files and feed new information to the channels.  Some games take advantage of this information 
and it would be nice to get the full functionality of these games working again.

What probably needs to be done?
===============================

Brushing up on assembly and understanding the file format of these channels.

Figuring out how to fake an RSA signature or create it.  Likely without the help of Nintendo.  Would be nice if 
they would open source that or something silly.
